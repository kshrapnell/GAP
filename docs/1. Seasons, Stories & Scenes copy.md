# Seasons, Stories & Scenes
Passage of time is an important aspect of the game, it helps to bring context, connection and believability to the characters and their world. Establishing families, building relationships with people over a period of years and exploring the drama in passing history. To help give a framework to the game’s year, it is split into 2 game **Seasons**; Spring & Summer (Easter to Michaelmas), Autumn & Winter (Michaelmas to Easter). 

The Spring & Summer season is the time for Stories, which is where the camera lingers on the drama as it plays out. The seasons of Autumn & Winter are condensed into opportunities for family, chronicle or campaign scenes. 

**Stories** contain the situations, ‘scenarios’ or ‘adventures’ that player are involved in. They are tend to be made up of a number of **Scenes.**

A **Scene** is way to think about a chunk of playable time, sometimes these are part of a longer Story and other times, especially in the Autumn & Winter seasons they can be condensed scenes to bring focus on a single situation or decision.

Minutes & Moments… [TODO]

Most scenes are not time critical and can be run without concern of timekeeping. A few scenes will need more granular management, combat being a good example. In this context, scenes are broken into minutes and further broken into moments. Ten moments are considered to be a minute, and this provides a basic framework for reference more than a tactical second by second tracker.
